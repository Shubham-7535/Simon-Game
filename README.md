Simon Game

The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game where players must recall and repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds. Each round, the game adds a new random color to the pattern, and the player must reproduce the full sequence correctly to advance.

🔹How the Game Work
  The game displays a sequence of colored buttons (e.g., Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
  Each color plays a unique sound when highlighted.
  After the sequence is shown, the player must click the buttons in the exact same order.
  If the player succeeds, the level increases and another color is added to the pattern.
  If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and the level resets.
